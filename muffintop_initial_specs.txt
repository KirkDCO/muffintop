## Requirements

* Must have an internal database of nutrient content of foods, such as FoodData Central from the USDA (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets).
* Must be able to create new foods from combinations of foods in the database and calcualte their overall nutrient content.  (This is creating a recipe.)
** Integrate with tblsp project database (~/Projects/tblsp) for one method of recipe creation.
* At minimum, track calories, protein, carbohydrate, and added sugar.
* Allow mutliple users to track their own data.
* Provide graphs of daily target calories (baseline and activity, given user inputs) and actual calorie intake.  
* Provide longitudinal graphs of intake over time.
* Allow users to track metrics such as body weight along with caloric and/or nutrient intake.
* Graphs should be interactive and adjustable - choose metrics to track, date ranges, include target indicators, etc.
* Designed to be hosted from a server that is accessible over a LAN.
